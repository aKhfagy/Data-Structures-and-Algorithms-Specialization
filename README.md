### N.B.
  - All the assigments were done in C++.
  - If you wish to use the problems outside of coursera you're free to use them. 
  - Don't use these problems to submit in the specialization as it violates the [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).
